!Series_summary	"Nickel compounds, important carcinogens and prime inducers of contact allergy in humans, are potent activators of endothelial cells (ECs). To elucidate the signaling pathways mediating the cellular responses to nickel we performed Affymetrix gene profiling of human primary ECs. "
!Series_summary	"Keywords: stress response"
!Series_overall_design	"HUVEC cultured under standard conditions were treated for 5h with 1.5 mM NiCl2 or left untreated before total RNA isolation and processing for microarray hybridization. Four independent experiments were performed, i.e. 8 samples (Control and experiment) were analyzed."
